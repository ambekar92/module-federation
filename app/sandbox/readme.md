# Sandbox Directory

This directory, `sandbox`, is a space for experimental work and proof-of-concept (PoC) components. It's a place where we can test new ideas, explore different approaches, and prototype functionality without affecting the main application code.

## Guidelines for Using the Sandbox Directory

1. **Experimental Work**: If you're working on a new feature or component and you're not yet sure how it should be implemented, you can create a version in the `sandbox` directory. This allows you to experiment freely without the risk of breaking existing functionality.

2. **Proof-of-Concept**: If you're exploring a new technology or technique, you can create a PoC in the `sandbox` directory. This allows you to demonstrate the feasibility of the technology or technique without integrating it into the main application code.

3. **Learning and Sharing**: If you've learned something new and you want to share it with the team, you can create an example in the `sandbox` directory. This allows other team members to learn from your work and provide feedback.

## Important Notes

- Code in the `sandbox` directory should not be considered production-ready. It's expected that code in this directory will be rough around the edges, and that's okay.

- Before moving code from the `sandbox` to a production directory, make sure it's fully tested and reviewed.

- Remember to keep the `sandbox` clean. If you're no longer working on a piece of experimental code, consider removing it to avoid clutter.

- While the `sandbox` is a space for experimentation, it's still important to follow good coding practices. Others may learn from your code, so try to keep it clean and well-commented.
